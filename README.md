# macro-keyboard-stream-deck-arduino-pro-micro
This project allows you to make a macro keyboard thanks to an arduino pro micro and some mechanical keyboard switches . The switches are programmed to go from F13 to F21.

## Build :

To make this macro keyboard, simply flash the hex code in the Arduino board using QMK Toolbox, solder the switches as shown in the electrical diagram, then put key caps on the switches, and finally fix everything in a 3D printed box or handcrafted.
